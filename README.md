## Setup

1) Create a project using the __[use this template]__ button located in the top right corner.
2) Navigate to [ [Settings](../../settings) > __[Environments](../../settings/environments)__ ] in your project.
3) Click "__New environment__" to create a new environment named `calibre-news`.

## Schedule

The default delivery is scheduled to occur daily at midnight (00:00) UTC. You can change it according to your preference. The cron expression `- cron: '0 0 * * *'` can be found in the workflow file located at:

```
/.github/workflows/calibre-news.yml
```

Please refer to the "__[schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)__" documentation to specify an appropriate time. For example, if you are in a timezone that is UTC+8 and want the delivery to start at 6:00 AM every day, you can set the cron expression as `0 22 * * *`, calculated using the formula `UTC Time = Local Time âˆ’ Offset`.

Additionally, you can manually trigger the delivery on the "__[Actions](../../actions)__" page of your project.

## Recipe

For the built-in recipes, you need to add their titles (found in the `Title` attribute of the recipe file) to the plain text file __[recipe_list.txt](recipe_list.txt)__, one title per line. For manually written recipes, simply place them in the root of the project.

You can specify the cover and style for a recipe. Place the cover image in the "__covers__" folder and the style file in the "__styles__" folder. Both filenames must match the corresponding recipe title or filename. Be aware that the style may be ignored by the Send to Kindle service.

You can upload the recipe files using either the Git tool or GitHub's online uploading feature. The best practice is to test the recipe locally to ensure no errors occur before uploading it.

## Notice

This project does not accept any PRs for adding recipes. Please do something interesting on your own.
